5.1 Analyze the following code. Is count < 100 always true, always false, or sometimes
true or sometimes false at Point A, Point B, and Point C?
int count = 0;
while (count < 100) {
// Point A
System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
count++;
// Point B
}
// Point C

5.2 What is wrong if guess is initialized to 0 in line 11 in Listing 5.3?
//
5.3 How many times are the following loop bodies repeated? What is the output of each
loop?
//
5.4 Suppose the input is 2 3 4 5 0. What is the output of the following code?
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
int number, max;
number = input.nextInt();
max = number;
while (number != 0) {
number = input.nextInt();
if (number > max)
max = number;
}
System.out.println("max is " + max);
System.out.println("number " + number);
}
}
//
5.5 What is the output of the following code? Explain the reason.
int x = 80000000;
while (x > 0)
x++;
System.out.println("x is " + x);
//
5.6 Suppose the input is 2 3 4 5 0. What is the output of the following code?
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
int number, max;
number = input.nextInt();
max = number;
do {
number = input.nextInt();
if (number > max)
max = number;
} while (number != 0);
System.out.println("max is " + max);
System.out.println("number " + number);
}
}
//
5.7 What are the differences between a while loop and a do-while loop? Convert the
following while loop into a do-while loop.
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
int sum = 0;
System.out.println("Enter an integer " +
"(the input ends if it is 0)");
int number = input.nextInt();
while (number != 0) {
sum += number;
System.out.println("Enter an integer " +
"(the input ends if it is 0)");
number = input.nextInt();
}
//
5.8 Do the following two loops result in the same value in sum?
//
5.9 What are the three parts of a for loop control? Write a for loop that prints the numbers
from 1 to 100.
//
5.10 Suppose the input is 2 3 4 5 0. What is the output of the following code?
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
int number, sum = 0, count;
for (count = 0; count < 5; count++) {
number = input.nextInt();
sum += number;
}
System.out.println("sum is " + sum);
System.out.println("count is " + count);
}
}
*****************************************************/
5.1:
a)always true
b)somtimes false
c)always false
5.2:
It would be wrong if it is initialized to a value between 0 and 100, because it could be the number you attempt to guess.
5.3:
(a) Infinite number of times.
(b) Infinite number of times.
(c) The loop body is executed nine times. The output is 3, 5, 7, 9 on separate lines.
5.4:
max is 5
number is 0
5.5:
x is -2147483648 
The reason: When a variable is assigned a value that is too large (in size) to be stored, it causes overflow. 
2147483647 + 1 is actually -2147483648
5.6:
max is 5 
number 0
5.7:
the loop condition is checked after excuting code with the do-while loop
5.8:
Same. When the i++ and ++i are used in isolation, their effects are same.
5.9:
The first part initializes the control variable. The second part is a Boolean expression that determines whether the loop will repeat. The third part is the adjustment statement, which adjusts the control variable.
5.10:
sum is 14 
count is 5
