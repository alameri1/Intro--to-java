14.1 Explain the evolution of Java GUI technologies.
//
14.2 Explain why this book teaches Java GUI using JavaFX.
//
14.3 How do you define a JavaFX main class? What is the signature of the start method?
What is a stage? What is a primary stage? Is a primary stage automatically created?
How do you display a stage? Can you prevent the user from resizing the stage? Can you
replace Application.launch(args) by launch(args) in line 22 in Listing 14.1?
//
14.4 Show the output of the following JavaFX program.
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
public class Test extends Application {
public Test() {
System.out.println("Test constructor is invoked");
}
@Override // Override the start method in the Application class
public void start(Stage primaryStage) {
System.out.println("start method is invoked");
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("launch application");
Application.launch(args);
}
}
//
14.5 How do you create a Scene object? How do you set a scene in a stage? How do you
place a circle into a scene?
//
14.6 What is a pane? What is a node? How do you place a node in a pane? Can you directly
place a Shape or an ImageView into a Scene? Can you directly place a Control or
a Pane into a Scene?
//
14.7 How do you create a Circle? How do you set its center location and radius? How
do you set its stroke color and fill color?
//
14.8 What is a binding property? What interface defines a binding property? What interface
defines a source object? What are the binding object types for int, long,
float, double, and boolean? Are Integer and Double binding properties? Can
Integer and Double be used as source objects in a binding?
//
14.9 Following the JavaFX binding property naming convention, for a binding property
named age of the IntegerProperty type, what is its value getter method, value
setter method, and property getter method?
//
14.10 Can you create an object of IntegerProperty using new IntegerProperty(3)?
If not, what is the correct way to create it? What will the output if line 8 is replaced
by d1.bind(d2.multiply(2)) in Listing 14.6? What will the output if line 8 is
replaced by d1.bind(d2.add(2)) in Listing 14.6?
//
14.11 What is a unidirectional binding and what is bidirectional binding? Are all binding
properties capable of bidirectional binding? Write a statement to bind property d1
with property d2 bidirectionally.
//
14.12 How do you set a style of a node with border color red? Modify the code to set the
text color for the button to red.
//
14.13 Can you rotate a pane, a text, or a button? Modify the code to rotate the button 15
degrees counterclockwise?
//
14.14 How do you create a color? What is wrong about creating a Color using new
Color(1.2, 2.3, 3.5, 4)? Which of two colors is darker, new Color(0, 0,
0, 1) or new Color(1, 1, 1, 1)? Does invoking c.darker() change the color
value in c?
//
14.15 How do you create a Color object with a random color?
//
14.16 How do you set a circle object c with blue fill color using the setFill method and
using the setStyle method?
//
14.17 How do you create a Font object with font name Courier, size 20, and weight
bold?
//
14.18 How do you find all available fonts on your system?
